# GP_Programming_CubeGame
Gameplay Programming Project 1

Produced SFML Game which utilises Vector3, Matrix3 and Quaternion library ports. The game should allow the player to rotate a series of shapes such as cubes using either arrow, WASD or Mouse or Gameloop. Each of the shape faces will have an individual colour. A smaller colour cube will jump along the Platform shapes and it color must match the face colour. If the cube and face match the cube can progress (jump) to the next shape until it reaches the gaol. The player jump should be implemented similar to http://gamemechanicexplorer.com/#platformer-6
